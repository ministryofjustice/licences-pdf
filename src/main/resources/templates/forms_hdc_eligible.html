<h1>Home detention curfew (tagging): eligible</h1>

<table class="wide">

        <td>Name: OFF_NAME</td>

<p>OFF_NAME</p>
<br/>
<p>You are eligible for early release from prison on home detention curfew (tagging).</p>

<h2>What this means for you</h2>
<p>This means you could be released from prison on SENT_HDCED if you:</p>

<ul class="disc">
    <li>behave well in prison</li>
    <li>have somewhere to live after you leave prison</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are released early you would have to:</p>

<ul class="disc">
    <li>stay at home during certain hours (your curfew)</li>
    <li>wear an electronic tag - to make sure you follow your curfew</li>
</ul>

<p>You would have a curfew and electronic tag until SENT_CRD.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p>Think about where you could live if you were released on SENT_HDCED. We will give you a form to fill in with the address
details closer to the date you can be released on home detention curfew.</p>

<p>If you can, think of a second address in case your first choice is not suitable.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t have a place to stay, Bail and Accommodation Support Services (BASS) could help you find somewhere.
We will pass your details on to BASS if you need it.</p>
